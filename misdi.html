							<h4>MG472: Global Strategy Management and Information Systems</h4>
							<p>The main focus of this course is to examine contemporary global strategies and management practices of corporations and government agencies across the world. In the context of Ghemawat calls 'semi-globalization' we examine how to analyse corporate and business strategies, competitiveness, and how organizations set up and manage structures, processes, human resources, and technologies to deliver on their objectives. Following through on this theme and context the course focuses more specifically on the social, managerial and political issues involved in the introduction and operation of information and communications technologies in organisations. The course analyses critically the opportunities and risks attached to the development and utilisation of information and communications technologies in contemporary organisations. The aim is to educate and inform future managers about strategy, management and information systems in the context of increasing globalization, and to establish the key choices and practices impacting on organizational and individual performance. Case studies are used to demonstrate the key issues. Topics covered include: Global strategic management; corporate and business level strategies; industry competition; competing through resources and capabilities; value creation; management functions, IS strategy and sourcing; IS projects, risk management and organisational change; role and governance of the IS function; IT-enabled business process (re)design; infrastructure; business and IS evaluation.

							<h4>MG481: Innovating Organisational Information Technology</h4>
							<p>The course provides students with a practical and theoretical insight into the processes and practices of developing contemporary Information Systems. The course reflects the diversity of contemporary information systems contexts; discussing how we should manage the development of complex Internet enabled systems and services. The course focuses on new technologies and practices including cloud and grid computing, open-source development, Software as a Service, Web2.0 mashups, mobile and ubiquitous information technology, technology to support knowledge work, innovating customer relationship management, mediating mutual adjustment and mass-scale mediated communities. The changing architectures of information systems towards an Internet based cloud are key themes of the course. Attention is however also given to the development of traditional ERP and information management systems which remain important in enterprises. The course also discusses the development challenges in small start-ups leveraging existing development platforms. Particular attention is given to problem structuring and problem design issues within such complex settings using Soft Systems Methodology and the Unified Modeling Language as a toolkit. Agile methods form a core part of the teaching, with Extreme Programming, Rapid Application Development and Internet-speed development contrasted with development formalism such as the Rational Unified Model and Capability Maturity Models. To ensure that students gain practical experience we include a two-week intensive "bootcamp" group project in which outside consultants present a "real-world" case study of systems development and the groups undertake to rapidly analyse and design a proposal for a technical solution. This allows students to support their theoretical understanding with a strong practical experience of the pressures and difficulties of systems development today. The "bootcamp" group project provides a realistic experience of developing systems within a consulting role, and is supported by classes and question and answer session and online discussion. Students gain an understanding of the benefits and difficulties of working within a small team under pressure.
